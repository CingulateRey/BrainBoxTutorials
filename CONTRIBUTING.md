# BrainBox tutorials  

### How can you help?  


This is a project where we will be able to learn about our brain as much as about how to build comprehensive tutorials. You can join us at any step! Help us building tutorials or test them and provide feedback on their helpfulness and what we could improve!  
 
It is a continuous project and we will update the below list of specific goals as they might be achieved. Our first target will be to create video/screencast tutorials as well as clear short write ups supported by pictures on how to do certain things.  
The second major step will be to test these tutorials and hopefully you will love it so much that you just cannot stop yourself from segmenting and become our next champion BrainBox user! ;)  

*For all our enthusiasts, we offer a small 3D printed model of the brain you have segmented! <3*  
 
 
 
**Specific tutorials we would love to focus on could include:**  
 - How to check & fix automatically generated segmentations in large data sets with BrainBox  
 - Segmentation sprint on a brain of a Dolphin with surface reconstruction  
 - How to get data from BrainBox and analyse it using a Jupyter notebook  
 - How to prepare your data for a BrainBox project
